## Project Overview
This project implements a classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates fundamental web development concepts and object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

## Features
- Interactive 3x3 game board
- Alternating turns between X and O players
- Win detection and highlighting of winning line
- Game state management
- Responsive design using Bootstrap

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Bootstrap 5.2.1)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Key Learning Points
1. HTML Structure:
   - Use of semantic HTML elements
   - Integration with Bootstrap for responsive layout

2. CSS Styling:
   - Custom styling for game board and squares
   - Use of classes for dynamic styling (e.g., highlighting winning line)

3. JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming:
   - Creation of a TTT (Tic Tac Toe) class to encapsulate game logic
   - Use of constructor and methods

4. DOM Manipulation:
   - Dynamic updating of game board
   - Event handling for player moves

5. Game Logic Implementation:
   - Win condition checking
   - Player turn management
   - Game state tracking

6. Array Manipulation:
   - Use of arrays to represent game board and winning combinations

7. ES6+ Features:
   - Use of let and const for variable declarations
   - Arrow functions
   - Destructuring assignment

8. Code Organization:
   - Separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JS for behavior)
   - Modular code structure within the TTT class

9. Event Binding:
   - Proper binding of 'this' context in event handlers

10. Responsive Design:
    - Use of Bootstrap classes for a mobile-friendly layout

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Click on an empty square to make a move
4. The game alternates between X and O players
5. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
6. The game ends when there's a winner or all squares are filled
